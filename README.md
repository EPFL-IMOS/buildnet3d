# BuildNet3D
Official code for "Exploiting Semantic Scene Reconstruction for Estimating Building Envelope Characteristics" (Building and Environment 2025)
## 3D Semantic Building Reconstruction
This repository extends [nerfstudio](https://docs.nerf.studio/) (v1.1.3) to reconstruct building envelope surface meshes with **appearance**, **geometry**, and **semantic** properties using SDF-based representations.

### Usage
```bash
# Reconstruction
python buildnet3d/scripts/reconstruct.py --model-type semantic-sdf --data <DIR_TO_DATA>
```


## Multi-Modal Imageset Generation
This repository uses `BlenderProc` to generate multi-modal image data from 3D building models. The rendered outputs include RGB, depth maps, surface normals, semantic labels, and instance segmentations. We implement a simple rule-based sampling method to randomly place camera viewpoints while ensuring the entire object remains within the view. More details are provided [here](bproc_generator/README.md). 

The generated **buildnet3d image dataset** is available [here](https://zenodo.org/records/15075790).

## Installation
